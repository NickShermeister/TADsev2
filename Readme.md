# Pace and Pull Software Aid for the Seeing Eye

The entirety of the Python application is contained in "Final_app.py". As this is a Python application, there are executables being made for computers that aren't able to run the command

```
python3 Final_app.py
```

## Dependencies

The full list of dependencies is:
* tkinter
* PIL
* pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy

It is recommended to use Pip3 to install the dependencies.

## Making Executables

It is recommended to use Pyinstaller in order to make the executables desired if updating the application. Due to inclusion of additional libraries, the .spec file needs to be edited (if it was autogenerated). In the .spec file, there should be an Analysis object created, as seen below.

```
a = Analysis(['Final_app.py'],
             pathex=['/home/nek/Documents/Classes/TAD'],
             binaries=[],
             datas=[],
             hiddenimports=[],
             hookspath=[],
             runtime_hooks=[],
             excludes=[],
             win_no_prefer_redirects=False,
             win_private_assemblies=False,
             cipher=block_cipher,
             noarchive=False)
```

The hiddenimports should be given a different value so that it includes the new libraries. Therefore, replace the original hiddenimports line with the following:

```
hiddenimports=['PIL', 'PIL._imagingtk', 'PIL._tkinter_finder'],
```

## Known Issues

Currently, there is limited feedback to the user if something happens. This is a known issue, but not one that there was time to resolve during the course of the semester. If you are trying to upload data, make sure:
1. You are trying to import a .csv
2. Your data has no empty values
3. You are using the correct distribution of the application for your operating system.
